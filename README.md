I tried directly to make two different containers with PHP and Apache.
The container w/ MySQL should be working but I didn't test it.
The containers w/ PHP and Apache stops after a while but the one with MySQL should be working normally.
It is just necessary to launch inside the bash:
```
sudo docker-compose up
```
